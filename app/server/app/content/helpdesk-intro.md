## Change a Submitted Formâ€™s Formio Status

Please search for a form by ID below (use _Application ID_ for Application form submissions or _Rebate ID_ for Payment Request form submissions). If the submission exists, it will be displayed in a table below the search box. In the table, view an existing submission or update it's Formio submission state from _Submitted_ back to _Draft_.
