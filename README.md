# U.S. EPA CSB Rebate Forms Application (i.e., Applicant Dashboard)
The CSB Rebate Forms Application allows eligible entities (e.g., school districts, state governments, bus vendors) to apply for rebates though the Clean School Bus Program, provide proof of purchase, and close out their programmatic obligations with the Agency. The Clean School Bus Program itself is authorized by Title XI, Section 71101 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58), commonly referred to as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL).
